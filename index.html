        I am Mina Norouzirad, a dedicated researcher in Mathematical Statistics with a Ph.D. from <a href="https://shahroodut.ac.ir/en/">Shahrood University of Technology</a>, Iran, 
      and currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="https://novamath.fct.unl.pt">NovaMath</a>, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal. With expertise in innovative methodologies for 
      statistical modeling, I focus on Shrinkage, Robust Regression, High-dimensional Analysis, and Machine Learning. My work has garnered recognition through peer-reviewed publications 
      and awards, and I am passionate about mentoring the next generation of statisticians. Proficient in R, Python, Julia, and SPSS, 
      I aim to contribute to the dynamic field of statistics, with an H-index (Google-Scholar) of 8 and over 180 citations, reflecting the impact of my research.
